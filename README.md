# School-work
My C and C++ introductory work for various classes

This code was written in 2013-2016, and I'm only making a repository for it as a storage method (and maybe also to drop comments in them). Most programs do exactly what they say they do. A few won't even compile correctly, and I have no intention of correcting those programs because I learned where my mistakes were, and I keep their errors because I'm prone to making similar mistakes and seeing those mistakes will remind me where my thinking went awry.
